Extract urban built-up area from remote sensing images 

This project aims at extracing urban built-up area from remote sensing images.Two import methoeds are used in this project,which are called IBI(index-based built-up index) and CA(cellular automata) model. We assumed that you have some basic skills in the context of remote sensing technology,and know how to caculate IBI from images that aquired from Landsat TM/ETM+ or Landsat OLI sensors. If you are not familiar with IBI,just reffered to the papers:

2) Xu H Q. A New Index for Delineating Built-up Land Features in Satellite Imagery [J]. International Journalof Remote Sensing, 2008, 29(14): 4269-4276.
